# uploadMedia



## Definition

Creates an acceptor which receives an HTTP POST binary upload. The acceptor will be opened on a specified port and the uploaded media file will be written on a specified directory. The acceptor then waits for an HTTP POST from a client with the media file as payload. The media file is then written on the specified location in the server.

------

### Notes

- The sending client must conform to the following:
  - It must send the data by way of HTTP POST
  - The POST request must be in http/1.1 format
  - A StreamName must be provided in the POST line. This will then be the filename of the media file (mp4) when written. (e.g., *POST /mystreamname HTTP/1.1\r\n*)
  - Content-type must be set to *video/mp4* or *application/octet-stream*
  - Content-length must be used. This function is intended for uploading VOD MP4 so the EMS will expect that the size of the file is already known
