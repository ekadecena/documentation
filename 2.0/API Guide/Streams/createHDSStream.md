|     targetFolder     | string  |   true    |                  *null*                  | The folder where all the manifest (*.f4m) and fragment (f4v*) files will be stored. This folder must be accessible by the HDS clients. It is usually in the web-root of the server |
|      bandwidths      | integer |   false   |                    0                     | The corresponding bandwidths for each stream listed in `localStreamNames`. Again, this can be a comma-delimited list |
|    chunkBaseName     | string  |   false   |                   f4v                    | The base name used to generate the fragments. The default value follows this format: **f4vSeg1-FragXXX** |
|     chunkLength      | integer |   false   |                    10                    | The length (in seconds) of fragments to be made. Minimum value is **1** (second) |
|      chunkOnIDR      | boolean |   false   |                 1 *true*                 | If **true**, chunking is performed ONLY on IDR. Otherwise, chunking is performed whenever chunk length is achieved |
|      groupName       | string  |   false   | *(if not specified, it will be a random name in the form of hds_group_xxxx)* | The name assigned to the HDS stream or group. If the `localStreamNames` parameter contains only one entry and `groupName` is not specified,`groupName` will have the value of the input stream name |
|      keepAlive       | boolean |   false   |                 1 *true*                 | If true, the EMS will attempt to reconnect to the stream source if the connection is severed |
|     manifestName     | string  |   false   |    *defaults to stream name if false*    | The manifest file name                   |
| overwriteDestination |         |   false   |                 1 *true*                 | If true, it will allow overwrite of destination files |
|     playlistType     | string  |   false   |                appending                 | Either **appending** or **rolling**      |
|    playlistLength    | integer |   false   |                    10                    | The number of fragments before the server starts to overwrite the older fragments. Used only when`playlistType` is **rolling**. Ignored otherwise |
| staleRetentionCount  | integer |   false   | *If not specified, it will have the value of playlistLength* | How many old files are kept besides the ones present in the current version of the playlist. Only applicable for **rolling** playlists |
| createMasterPlaylist | boolean |   false   |                 1 *true*                 | If **true**, a master playlist will be created |
|  cleanupDestination  | boolean |   false   |                0 *false*                 | If **true**, all manifest and fragment files in the target folder will be removed before HDS creation is started |
