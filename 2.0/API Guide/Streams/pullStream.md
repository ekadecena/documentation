# pullStream



## Definition

This will try to pull in a stream from an external source. Once a stream has been successfully pulled it is assigned a “local stream name” which can be used to access the stream from the EMS.

|    sendRenewStream    | boolean |                  false                   |          0 *false*          | If **true**, the server will send RenewStream via SET_PARAMETER when a new client connects. Only valid for RTSP URIs |

#### JSON Response

The JSON response contains the following details:

- data – The data to parse
  - audioCodecBytes - The audio codec setup of thisRTP stream if it is audio
  - configID – The configuration ID for this command
  - emulateUserAgent – This is the string that the EMS uses to identify itself with the other server. It can be modified so that EMS identifies itself as, say, a Flash Media Server
  - forceTcp – Whether TCP MUST be used, or if UDP can be used
  - httpProxy - May either be **IP:Port** combination or **Self**
  - isAudio - Indicates if the currently pulled stream is an audio source

    - fullParameters – The parameters for the source stream’s URI
    - fullUri – The full URI of the source stream
    - fullUriWithAuth – The full URI with authentication of the source stream
    - host – Name of the source stream’s host
    - ip – IP address of the source stream’s host
    - originalUri – The source stream’s URI where it was generated
    - parameters – Parameters for the source stream’s URI (if any)
    - password – Password for authenticating the source stream (if required)
    - port – Port used by the source stream
    - portSpecified – True if the port for the source stream is specified
    - scheme – The protocol used by the source stream
    - userName – The user name for authenticating the source stream (if required)


- description– Describes the result of parsing/executing the command

## Notes

- When you want to record the content of your pulled stream using `record`, `createHLSStream`, or commands similar to these, it is advisable to call the recording command first before issuing the `pullStream` command. The rationale for this is because the pulled stream will already be running in the background once pulled. This may become the reason for missing some of the stream's content if it is already running beforehand, and the recording configuration has not started up yet.
