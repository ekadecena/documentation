|      groupName       | string  |   false   |        *mss_group_xxxx (random)*         | The name assigned to the MSS stream or group. If the `localStreamNames` parameter contains only one entry and groupName is not specified,  `groupName` will have the value of the input stream name |
|     playlistType     | string  |   false   |                Appending                 | Either **appending** or **rolling**      |

|     manifestName     | string  |   false   |              manifest.ismc               | The manifest file name                   |
|     chunkLength      | integer |   false   |                    10                    | The length (in seconds) of fragments to be made |
|      chunkOnIDR      | boolean |   false   |                0 *false*                 | If **true**, chunking is performed ONLY on IDR. Otherwise, chunking is performed whenever chunk length is achieved |
|      keepAlive       | boolean |   false   |                 1 *true*                 | If **true**, the EMS will attempt to reconnect to the stream source if the connection is severed |
| overwriteDestination | boolean |   false   |                 1 *true*                 | If **true**, it will allow overwrite of destination files |
| staleRetentionCount  | integer |   false   | *If not specified, it will have the value of playlistLength* | How many old files are kept besides the ones present in the current version of the playlist. Only applicable for **rolling** playlists |
|  cleanupDestination  | boolean |   false   |                0 *false*                 | If **true**, all manifest and fragment files in the target folder will be removed before MSS creation is started |
|       ismType        | string  |   false   |                   ismc                   | Either **ismc** for serving content to client or **isml** for serving content to smooth server |
|        isLive        | boolean |   false   |                 1 *true*                 | If **true**, creates a live MSS stream, otherwise set to **0** for **VOD** |
|   publishingPoint    | string  |   false   |                  *none*                  | This parameter is needed when `ismType=isml`, it is the REST URI where the mss contents will be ingested |
|      ingestMode      | string  |   false   |                  single                  | Either **single** for a non looping ingest or **loop** for looping an ingest |
