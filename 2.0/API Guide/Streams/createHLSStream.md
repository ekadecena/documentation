This will be the size of file before chunking it to another file, this replace the`chunkLength` in case of EXT-X-BYTERANGE, since `chunkLength` will be the byte range chunk |
|    useSystemTime     | boolean |   false   |                0 *false*                 | If true, uses UTC in playlist time stamp otherwise will use the local server time |
