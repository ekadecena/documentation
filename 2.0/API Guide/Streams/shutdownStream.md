# shutdownStream



## Definition

Terminates a specific stream. When `permanently=1` is used, this command is analogous to`removeConfig`.





## API Parameter Table

| Parameter Name  |  Type   | Mandatory |    Default Value     | Description                              |
| :-------------: | :-----: | :-------: | :------------------: | ---------------------------------------- |
|       id        | integer |   true    |         null         | The unique Id of the stream that needs to be terminated. The stream ID’s can be obtained using the `listStreams` command. This parameter is not mandatory but either this or `localStreamName` should be present to identify the particular stream |
| localStreamName | string  |   true    | *zero length string* | The name of the inbound stream which you wish to terminate. This will also terminate any outbound streams that are dependent upon this input stream. This parameter is not mandatory but either this or the id should be present to identify the particular stream |
|   permanently   | boolean |   false   |       1 *true*       | If **true**, the corresponding push/pull configuration will also be terminated. Therefore, the stream will NOT be reconnected when the server restarts |

## Notes

- The stream ID shown by the `listStreams` command is not the same as the config ID shown by the `listConfig` command. The `shutdownStream` command uses the stream ID, not the config ID.
