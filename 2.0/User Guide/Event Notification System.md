# Event Notification System

The EMS Event Notification System provides an extremely powerful way of interacting with the EMS. At the basic level it allows you to easily understand and monitor the usage of your server. You can either poll and parse the log file, or simply subscribe to the HTTP based notifications sent out by the EMS. **The notifications mean that you can have a fully RESTful monitor, gathering metrics in real time!**

Beyond monitoring and gathering metrics, you can **use the Event Notification System to create custom stream processing.** If you want to automatically create HLS/HDS/MSS/DASH streams out of new inbound streams, simply call createHLSStream/createHDSStream/createMSSStream/createDASHStream in response to each “new inbound stream” event. If you want to close inbound streams when the associated outbound stream is lost, call shutdownStream when you receive an “outbound stream closed” event.



## Configuring Event Notifications

Events can be sent to multiple destinations, or “sinks”, at the same time. A “sink” can be either a file or a network destination. Multiple sinks can be enabled at the same time, allowing you to both log events and receive them in your web service(s). These sinks can be configured so that only the events you will be consuming will be generated. Event Sinks are configured in the `config/config.lua` file.

```
eventLogger=
{
    sinks=
    {
        type="sink1_type",
        -- property1 of sink1
        -- property2 of sink1
    },
    enabledEvents=
    {
        "inStreamCreated",
        "inStreamClosed",
    }
},
```

### Enabling Event Logs

Event Notifications are off by default. To use the Event Notification System, you must modify the EMS configuration file.

1.  Remove comment to the eventLogger section in the configuration `--[[ ]]--`

2.  Select your preferred filename and file format

3.  Configure time-stamp if to be used

4.  Select events that will be enabled under `enabledEvents`

    **Notes:**

    - Only the events selected will be shown in the logs
    - See list of events [here](##Events/ List)




## Event Sinks

There are two main types of event sinks, the File Event Sink and the Remote Procedure Calls Event Sink

### File Event Sink

Event details are written to a log file located relative to the current directory. The log file is overwritten each time the EMS starts up.

```
type="file",
filename="log.txt",
format="text",
customData="my custom data"
```

File sink configuration:

The format can be one of the following types:

- “text” (plain text)
- “xml”
- “json”
- “w3c”

A typical configuration of a file sink follows:

```
eventLogger=
  {
      sinks=
      {
          {
              type="file",
              filename="../logs/events.txt",
              --format="text",
              --format="xml",
              --format="json",
              format="w3c",
              timestamp=true,
              appendTimestamp=true,
              appendInstance=true,
              fileChunkLength=43200, -- 12 hours (in seconds)
              fileChunkTime="18:00:00",
              enabledEvents=
              {
                  "inStreamCreated",
                  "outStreamCreated",
                  "streamCreated",
                  -- content removed for clarity
              },
              {
                  -- content removed for clarity
              },
          },
      },
  },

```



#### File Sink Structure Table

|       Key       |  Type   | Mandatory | Description                              |
| :-------------: | :-----: | :-------: | ---------------------------------------- |
|   customData    | object  |    no     | Custom data that will be appended to all events generated by this sink. It overrides the custom data node defined on the upper level. It can also be a complex structure, see illustration above. |
|      type       | string  |    yes    | The type of sink, “file”.                |
|    filename     | string  |    yes    | The base name of the file.               |
|     format      | string  |    yes    | Sets the file format. Allowed values are “text”, “xml”, “json” and “w3c” |
|    timestamp    | boolean |    no     |                                          |
| appendTimestamp | boolean |    no     | Sets the option to append a timestamp. If true, timestamp (YYYYMMDD_HHmmSS) is appended on every log file created. Otherwise, a 4-digit running number is appended. Default value is true. |
| appendInstance  | boolean |    no     | Appends a random 4-digit instance ID after every log file. Default is false. |
| fileChunkLength | number  |    no     | Number of seconds to create new file.    |
|  fileChunkTime  | string  |    no     | Time of the day to chunk log file, in HH:MM:SS format. *Note__: No file chunking when fileChunkLength and fileChunkTime are both present.* |
|  enabledEvents  | object  |    no     | Events that are logged. If not set, all are logged. But for W3C, non-stream-related events are ignored. |

As indicated above, the name of the file can be set using a number of options. For example,

```
filename = "/var/evostreamms/logs/streams"
appendTimestamp = true
appendInstance = true

```

The log file would be `/var/evostreamms/logs/streams_0237_20140311_183046.txt`.



### RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) Event Sink

Event details are transmitted to a remote host via HTTP POST. The EMS will ignore any response from the remote host.

RPC sink configuration:

```
type="RPC",
url="http://192.168.1.5:5555/something/service",
serializerType="JSON",
customData="my custom data"
```

The `url` field specifies the destination which will be accepting the HTTP POST event notifications..

The `serializer` type can be one of the following formats:

- **JSON**

```
{"payload":{"creationTimestamp":1349335053486.4370,"name":"","queryTimestamp":1349335053487.4370,"type":"NR","uniqueId":1,"upTime":1.0000},"type":"streamCreated"}

```

- **XML**

```
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<MAP isArray="false" name="">
    <MAP isArray="false" name="payload">
        <DOUBLE name="creationTimestamp">1349335287346.813</DOUBLE>
        <STR name="name"></STR>
        <DOUBLE name="queryTimestamp">1349335287346.813</DOUBLE>
        <STR name="type">NR</STR>
        <UINT64 name="uniqueId">1</UINT64>
        <DOUBLE name="upTime">0.000</DOUBLE>
    </MAP>
<STR name="type">streamCreated</STR>
</MAP>

```

- **XMLRPC**

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<methodCall>
    <methodName>event.Log</methodName>
    <params>
        <param>
            <value>
                <struct>
                    <member>
                        <name>payload</name>
                        <value>

                            </member>
                            <!-- contents removed for clarity -->
                            </struct>
                        </value>
                    </member>
                    <member>
                        <name>type</name>
                        <value><string>streamCreated</string></value>
                    </member>
                </struct>
            </value>
        </param>
    </params>
</methodCall>

```

The `customData` parameter for both File and RPC Event Sinks can be *optionally* used to extra data to each event for that sink. This could be used to identify the particular EMS instance which is generating the event, return a particular ID or Key which is pertinent to your handling of the event, or anything really! A customData parameter can be a simple sting value or a complex LUA object.

If a `customData` parameter is not specified for a node, the value of the parent eventLogger customData node will be used. If that is also not specified, the value will be V_NULL.



## Application vs. Server Events

The config.lua file has two eventLogger sections as follows:

1. Application-owned – This is lower in the file and is “inside” the application configuration section. It configures “application level” events. **This is the recommended configuration section to modify.**
2. Server-wide (or default) – This is higher in the file and is at the outer-most variable scope level. This section configures events that are outside the application or events which the application level fails to catch. This is typically only for system events like server startup, server shutdown and application load.
